-- Naming Explaination --

* [Check Variables] - variable only for checking, do not adjust the value of
the variables, but you can use to check to see the effect during runtime.

* [Initialize Variables] - variable only work in initialize time, so set
the variable before hitting play button.

* [Runtime Variables] - variable will work on both initialize time and
runtime, you can adjust the variable during runtime and see the effect.

* [Helper Variables] - variable only happens in developer mode, so it won't
exist in the final build. Usually the helper tool in for level designer.
